# DevOps
DevOps revolves around a set of core principles that guide its implementation and practices. These principles
include:
•Collaboration – DevOps encourages open communication and collaboration between development and operations
teams, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and accountability.

•Automation – Automation is a cornerstone of DevOps. It streamlines processes, reduces human error, and allows for
faster delivery and improved consistency.

•Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) – CI/CD is the practice of automatically building, testing,and deploying software changes to production. This approach ensures a continuous flow of high-quality software releases.

•Feedback and Monitoring – DevOps emphasizes the importance of monitoring and gathering feedback from both technical and business stakeholders to improve processes and continuously iterate on products.

•Continuous Learning and Improvement – A commitment to continuous learning and improvement is essential in a DevOps culture. Teams should regularly evaluate their processes and tools to identify areas for growth and optimization.

•Faster Delivery and Time-to-Market – DevOps practices enable quicker software releases, allowing your organization to respond more effectively to market changes and customer demands.

•Improved Quality and Reliability – Through automation, continuous integration, and testing, DevOps helps ensure that the software delivered is of high quality, reliable, and secure.

•Enhanced Collaboration and Communication – DevOps fosters a culture of open communication and collaboration, breaking down silos between teams and leading to better alignment, shared goals, and more efficient processes.

•Cost Savings – By reducing the time spent on manual tasks and streamlining workflows, DevOps can lead to significant cost savings for your organization.

 # Git Hub : 
 Git is not Github. Git is the version control software, and
Github is a git repository hosting service which offers all
the source code management provided in git. Github is
where you upload your git repository.

     # Centralized Version Controlling:The systems such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforcehave a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place.
     
     # Distributed Version Controlling:In a DVCS (such as Git), clients don’t just check out the lates snapshot ofthe files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history.Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via thatserver, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a 
full backup of all the data
